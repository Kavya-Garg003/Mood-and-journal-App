# ✨ Mood in One Click

A cute, interactive **mood tracking and journaling web app** built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.
The app allows users to log their daily mood with a single emoji click, write journal entries, view mood history, track streaks, and see simple mood statistics — all stored locally in the browser.
